@section ReadWrite_intro_section Description

Example program for reading and writing to one or more Fujitsu SRAM memory devices on the I2C
microLAN. FRAM memory is static RAM which offers many Read/Write cycles and the description of the
MB85 family is found at http://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/devices/semiconductor/memory/fram/
and the corresponding datasheets are at
http://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/devices/semiconductor/memory/fram/lineup/#standard
Adafruit has two of these memories available on breakout boards,
https://www.adafruit.com/product/1897 and https://www.adafruit.com/product/1897 (this one is SPI,
but the chip is also available as I2C\n\n

The program makes use of the https://github.com/Zanduino/MB85_FRAM library, the most recent version
of which can be downloaded at https://github.com/Zanduino/MB85_FRAM/archive/master.zip \n\n

The following memories in the MB85 are detected and supported:\n\n
MB85RC512T 512Kbit ( 64K x 8bit) ManufacturerID 0x00A, Product ID = 0x658 (Density = 0x6)\n
MB85RC256V 256Kbit ( 32K x 8bit) ManufacturerID 0x00A, Product ID = 0x510 (Density = 0x5)\n
MB85RC128A 128Kbit ( 16K x 8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values\n
MB85RC64TA  64Kbit (  8K x 8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values\n
MB85RC64A   64Kbit (  8K x 8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values\n
MB85RC64V   64Kbit (  8K x 8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values\n\n
- unsupported memories --\n\n
MB85RC1MT    1Mbit (128K x 8bit) ManufacturerID 0x00A, Product ID = 0x758 (Density = 0x7)
(unsupported)\n MB85RC16    16Kbit (  2K x 8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values  1
Address byte   (unsupported)\n MB85RC16V   16Kbit (  2K x 8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or
Density values  1 Address byte   (unsupported)\n MB85RC04V    4Kbit ( 512 x 8bit) No
ManufacturerID/productID or Density values  1 Address byte   (unsupported)\n\n

What sets this library apart is that it will autmatically detect up to 8 memories, in any
combination of those listed as supported above, and treats them as one contiguous block of memory.
The read() and write() functions also support structures and arrays. Although the internal I2C
library has a 32 byte limitation on the buffer size, the library allows for larger structures to be
read and written.

@section ReadWrite_doxygen doxygen configuration
This library is built with the standard "Doxyfile", which is located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/blob/main/Doxygen. As described on that page, there are only 5
environment variables used, and these are set in the project's actions file, located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/MB85_FRAM/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-doxygen.yml
Edit this file and set the 5 variables: PRETTYNAME, PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_NUMBER, PROJECT_BRIEF and
PROJECT_LOGO so that these values are used in the doxygen documentation.
The local copy of the doxyfile should be in the project's root directory in order to do local
doxygen testing, but the file is ignored on upload to GitHub.

@section ReadWrite_format clang-format
Part of the GitHub actions for CI is running every source file through "clang-format" to ensure
that coding formatting is done the same for all files. The configuration file ".clang-format" is
located at https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/tree/main/clang-format and this is used for CI tests
when pushing to GitHub. The local file, if present in the root directory, is ignored when
committing and uploading.
