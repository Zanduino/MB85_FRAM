 @mainpage Arduino Library Header to access the MB85 Family of SRAM Memories

 @section intro_section Description

Class definition header for the Fujitsu MB85_FRAM family of memories. The I2C M85xxx memories are
described at
http://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/devices/semiconductor/memory/fram/lineup/index.html and the
list is detailed below:\n\n

MB85RC512T 512Kbit ( 64Kx8bit) ManufacturerID 0x00A, Product ID = 0x658 (Density = 0x6)\n
MB85RC256V 256Kbit ( 32Kx8bit) ManufacturerID 0x00A, Product ID = 0x510 (Density = 0x5)\n
MB85RC128A 128Kbit ( 16Kx8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values\n
MB85RC64TA  64Kbit (  8Kx8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values (1.8 to 3.6V)\n
MB85RC64A   64Kbit (  8Kx8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values (2.7 to 3.6V)\n
MB85RC64V   64Kbit (  8Kx8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values (3.0 to 5.5V)\n\n
- unsupported memories --\n\n
MB85RC1MT    1Mbit (128Kx8bit) ManufacturerID 0x00A, Product ID = 0x758 (Density = 0x7)     (unsp)\n
MB85RC16    16Kbit (  2Kx8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values  1 Address byte(unsp)\n
MB85RC16V   16Kbit (  2Kx8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values  1 Address byte(unsp)\n
MB85RC04V    4Kbit ( 512x8bit) No ManufacturerID/productID or Density values  1 Address
byte(unsp)\n\n

There is no direct means of identifying the various chips (apart from the top 3 in the list), so a
software method is used which makes use of the fact that writing past the end of memory
automatically wraps back around to the beginning. Thus if we write something 1 byte past the end of
a chip's address range then byte 0 of the memory will have changed.

 @section doxygen doxygen configuration

 This library is built with the standard "Doxyfile", which is located at
 https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/blob/main/Doxygen. As described on that page, there are only 5
 environment variables used, and these are set in the project's actions file, located at
 https://github.com/Zanduino/MB85_FRAM/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-doxygen.yml
 Edit this file and set the 5 variables -  PRETTYNAME, PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_NUMBER, PROJECT_BRIEF
 and PROJECT_LOGO so that these values are used in the doxygen documentation.
 The local copy of the doxyfile should be in the project's root directory in order to do local
 doxygen testing, but the file is ignored on upload to GitHub.

 @section clang-format
 Part of the GitHub actions for CI is running every source file through "clang-format" to ensure
 that coding formatting is done the same for all files. The configuration file ".clang-format" is
 located at https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/tree/main/clang-format and this is used for CI tests
 when pushing to GitHub. The local file, if present in the root directory, is ignored when
 committing and uploading.
